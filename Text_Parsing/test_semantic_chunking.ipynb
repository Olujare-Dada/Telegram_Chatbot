Representations of information may range from highly conceptual or summarized to very detail ed. In determining how much  detail each stakeholder may require as the initiative evolves, co nsideration is given to the needs of the stakeholders, the complexity of what is being explained, and the importance of the change. Rather than present the same information to all stakeholders, business analysts should present inform ation with appropriate breadth and level of detail based on each stakeholder' s role. Business analysis information regarding a topic of significant importance  or high level of risk is frequently represented in greater detail. .3 Plan Traceability Approach The traceability approach is based on: • the complexity of the domain, • the number of views of requirements that will be produced, • any requirement-related risks, organizational standards, applicable regulatory requirements, and • an understanding of the costs and benefits involved with tracing.

Analysis of business rules involves ca pturing business rules from sources, expressing them clearly, validating them with stakeholders, refi ning them to best align with business goals, and organizi ng them so they can be effectively managed and reused. Sources of business rules may be explicit (for example, documented business policies, regulations, or contracts) or tacit (for example, undocumented stakeholder know-how, genera lly accepted business practices, or norms of the corporate culture). Business rules should be explicit, specific, clear, accessible, and single sourced. Basic principles for business rules include: • basing them on standard business vo cabulary to enable domain subject matter experts to validate them, • expressing them separately from  how they will be enforced, • defining them at the atomic le vel and in declarative format, • separating them from processes they support or constrain,• mapping them to decisions the rule supports or constrains, and• maintaining them in a manner such  that they can be monitored and adapted as business circumstances evolve over time.

The BABOK® Guide  describes business analysis knowledge areas, tasks, underlying competencies, techniques and perspectives on how to approach business analysis. 1.1 Purpose of the BABOK® Guide The primary purpose of the BABOK® Guide  is to define the profession of business analysis and provide a set of commonly a ccepted practices. It helps practitioners discuss and define the skills necessary to effectively perform business analysis': 11,\n",

Business analysis is a broad profession in which business an alysts might perform work for many different types of initiative s across an enterprise. Practitioners may employ different competencies, knowledge, skills, terminology, and attitudes that they use when performing busi ness analysis tasks. The BABOK® Guide  is a common framework for all perspectives, describing business analysis tasks that are performed to properly analyze a change or evaluate the necessity for a change. Tasks may vary in form, order, or importance for individual business analysts or for various initiatives. The six knowledge areas of the BABOK ® Guide (Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring, Elicitation and Collaboratio n, Requirements Life Cycle Management, Strategy Analysis, Requirements Analys is and Design Defi nition (RADD), and What is Business Analysis?': 11,\n",

The following image shows how three of the knowledge areas support the delivery of business value before, during, and after the life cycle of a project. Figure 1.1.1: Business Analysis Beyond Projects 1.2 What is Business Analysis? Business analysis is the prac tice of enabling change in an enterprise by defining needs and recommending solu tions that deliver value to stakeholders. Business analysis enables an enterprise to articu late needs and the rationale for change, and to design and describe solutions that can deliver value. Business analysis is performed on a vari ety of initiatives wi thin an enterprise. Initiatives may be strategic, tactical, or  operational. Business analysis may be performed within the boundaries of a proj ect or throughout enterprise evolution and continuous improvement.': 12,\n",
       " 'It can be used to understand the current state, to define the future state, and to determine the activities required to move from the current to the future state. Business analysis can be performed from  a diverse array of perspectives. The BABOK® Guide  describes several of these pe rspectives: agile, business intelligence, information technology, business architecture, and business process management. A perspective can be thought of as a lens through which the business analysis practition er views their work activi ties based on the current context. One or many perspectives may apply to an initiative, and the perspectives outlined in the BABOK ® Guide  do not represent all the contexts for business analysis or the complete set of  business analysis disciplines. 1.3 Who is a Business Analyst? A business analyst is any person who perform s business analysis tasks described in the BABOK® Guide , no matter their job title or organizational role.

The busine ss analyst is respon sible for eliciting the actual needs of stakeh olders—which frequently involves investigating and clarifying their expressed desires—in order to determine underlying issues and causes. Business analysts play a role  in aligning the designed and delivered solutions with the needs of stakeholders. The activities that business analysts perform include: • understanding enterprise problems and goals,• analyzing needs and solutions,• devising strategies,• driving change, and • facilitating stakeholder collaboration. Other common job titles for people wh o perform business analysis include: • business architect,• business systems analyst,• data analyst,• enterprise analyst,• management consultant, • process analyst, • product manager,• product owner,• requirements engineer, and• systems analyst.': 13,\n",

       " \".2 Level of Abstraction Level of abstraction describes the breadth and depth of the information being provided. Representations of information may range from highly conceptual or summarized to very detail ed. In determining how much  detail each stakeholder may require as the initiative evolves, co nsideration is given to the needs of the stakeholders, the complexity of what is being explained, and the importance of the change. Rather than present the same information to all stakeholders, business analysts should present inform ation with appropriate breadth and level of detail based on each stakeholder' s role. Business analysis information regarding a topic of significant importance  or high level of risk is frequently represented in greater detail. .3 Plan Traceability Approach The traceability approach is based on: • the complexity of the domain, • the number of views of requirements that will be produced, • any requirement-related risks, organizational standards, applicable regulatory requirements, and • an understanding of the costs and benefits involved with tracing. Business analysts plan to ensure the approa ch is at a level of detail to add value without excessive overhead. .4 Plan for Requirements Reuse Reusing requirements can save an organization time, effort, and cost—provided the requirements are accessible and struct ured in a manner that supports their reuse.

In order for requirements to be reused they must be clearly named, defined, and stored in a repository that is av ailable to other business analysts. .5 Storage and Access Business analysis information can be st ored in many ways. Storage decisions depend on many factors such as who must access the information, how often they need to access it, and what co nditions must be present for access. Organizational standards and tool availabi lity also influence storage and access decisions. The business analysis approach  defines how various tools will be used on the initiative and how the informatio n will be captured and stored within those tools. Tools may shape the selection of business analysis techniques, notations to be used, and the wa y that information is organized. The repository may need to store information other than requirements and designs. It should be able to indicate th e status of any stored information, and allow for modification of that information over time. .6 Requirements Attributes Requirements attributes provide informat ion about requirements, and aid in the ongoing management of the requirements throughout the change.': 55,\n",

The assessment of existing and needed reso urces is considered when performing a feasibility analysis on possible soluti on approaches for th e change strategy. .10 Identify Assumptions Most strategies are predicated on a se t of assumptions that will determine whether or not the strategy can succeed, particularly when oper ating in a highly uncertain environment. It will often be difficult or impossible to prove that the delivery of a new capability will meet a business need, even in cases where it appears reasonable to assume that the new capability will have the desired effect. These assumptions must be identified and clearly understood, so that appropriate decisions can be made if the assumption later proves invalid.

Business analysts estimate a total risk  level from the aggregated se t of risks, indicating the overall potential impact for the risks bein g assessed. In some cases overall risk level can be quantified in financial terms, or in an amount of time, effort, or other measures. .4 Risk Tolerance How much uncertainty a stakeholder or an enterprise is willing to take on in exchange for potential value is referred to as risk tolerance. In general, there are three broad ways of describing attitude toward risk: •Risk-aversion : An unwillingness to accept much uncertainty; there may be a preference to either avoid a course of action which carries too high a level of risk, or to invest more (and theref ore accept a lower potential value) to reduce the risks. •Neutrality : some level of risk is acceptable , provided the course of action does not result in a loss  even if the risks occur. •Risk-seeking : A willingness to accept or even  take on more risk in return': 132,\n",
       " 'for a higher potential value. An individual or organization may exhibi t different risk tolerances at different times. If there is low tolerance for risk , there may be more effort on avoidance, transfer or mitigation strategies. If the tolerance for risk is high, more risks are likely to be accepted. Typically, the hi ghest level risks are dealt with no matter what the risk tolerance level. .5 Recommendation Based on the analysis of risks, business analysts recommend a course of action.

There may be more than one backlog. Fo r example, one backlog may be used to manage a global set of items, while a se cond backlog may be used to manage the items that are due to be worked on within the very near future. 10.2.3 Elements .1 Items in the Backlog Backlog items may be any kind of item wh ich may have work associated with it.

To differentiate between the high priority items, a more gr anular approach is used to specify the relative priority to other high priority it ems, such as a numerical ranking based on some measure of value. .3 Estimation The level of detail used to describe each backlog item may vary considerably. Items near the top of the backlog are usually described in more detail, with a correspondingly accurate estimate about th eir relative size an d complexity that would help to determine the cost and effort to complete them.': 232,\n",

As the work progresses on other items in the backlog, an  individual item’s relative priority may rise, leading to a need to review it and possibly further elaborate or decompose it to better understand and esti mate its size and complexity.

A business policy is a directive concerned with broadly contro lling, influencing, or regulating the actions of an enterprise and the people in it. A business rule is a specific, testable directive that serves as a criterion for guiding behaviour, shaping judgments, or making decisions. A business rule must be practicable (needing no further Techniques Business Rules Analysis': 250,\n",
       " '241Complimentary IIBA® Member Copy. Not for Distribution or Resale.interpretation for use by people in the bu siness) and is always under the control of the business. Analysis of business rules involves ca pturing business rules from sources, expressing them clearly, validating them with stakeholders, refi ning them to best align with business goals, and organizi ng them so they can be effectively managed and reused. Sources of business rules may be explicit (for example, documented business policies, regulations, or contracts) or tacit (for example, undocumented stakeholder know-how, genera lly accepted business practices, or norms of the corporate culture). Business rules should be explicit, specific, clear, accessible, and single sourced. Basic principles for business rules include: • basing them on standard business vo cabulary to enable domain subject matter experts to validate them, • expressing them separately from  how they will be enforced, • defining them at the atomic le vel and in declarative format, • separating them from processes they support or constrain,• mapping them to decisions the rule supports or constrains, and• maintaining them in a manner such  that they can be monitored and adapted as business circumstances evolve over time. A set of rules for making an operational business decision may be expressed as a decision table or decision tree, as described in Decision Analysis (p. 261).': 251,\n",
       " 'The number of rules in such a set can be quite large, with a high level of complexity. 10.9.3 Elements Business rules require consistent use of bu siness terms, a glossary of definitions for the underlying business concepts, and an understanding of the structural connections among the concepts. Reuse of existing terminology from external industry associations or internal business  glossaries is often advised. Sometimes definitions and structures from data dict ionaries or data models can be helpful (see Data Dictionary (p. 2 47) and Data Modelling (p. 2 56)). Business rules should be expressed and managed independently of any implementation technology since they need to be available for refere nce by business people.': 251,\n",
       " 'In addition, they sometimes will be implemented in multip le platforms or software components. There are frequently exceptions to busine ss rules; these should  be treated simply as additional business rules. Existing business rules should be challenged to ensure they align with business goals an d remain relevant, especially when new solutions emerge. .1 Definitional Rules Definitional rules shape concepts, or pr oduce knowledge or information. They indicate something that is necessaril y true (or untrue) about some concept, thereby supplementing its definition. In co ntrast to behavioural rules, which are about the behaviour of people, defini tional rules repr esent operational Business Rules Analysis Techniques': 251,\n",
       " '242Complimentary IIBA® Member Copy. Not for Distribution or Resale.knowledge of the organization. Definitional rules cannot be violated but they can be misapplied. An example of  a definitional rule is: A customer must be considered a Preferred Customer if they place more than 10 orders per month. Definitional rules often prescribe how in formation may be derived, inferred or calculated based on information available to the business. An inference or calculation may be the result of multiple rules, each building on something inferred or calculated by some other(s). Se ts of definitional rules are often used to make operational business decisions duri ng some process or upon some event. An example of a calculation rule is:': 252,\n",
       " \"An order's local jurisdiction tax amount  must be calculated as (sum of the prices of all the order's taxable ordere d items) × local jurisdiction tax rate amount. .2 Behavioural Rules Behavioural rules are people rules–ev en if the behaviour is automated. Behavioural rules serve to shape (govern) da y-to-day business ac tivity. They do so by placing some obligation or prohibit ion on conduct, action, practice, or procedure. Behavioural rules are rules the organizati on chooses to enfo rce as a matter of policy, often to reduce risk or enhance productivity. They frequently make use of the information or knowledge produced by definitional rules (which are about shaping knowledge or information). Behavi oural rules are intended to guide the actions of people working within the organi zation, or people who interact with it. They may oblige individuals to perform actions in a certain way, prevent them from carrying out actions, or prescribe the conditions under which something can be correctly done. An example of a behavioural rule is:\": 252,\n",
       " 'An order must not be placed when the billing address provided by the customer does not match the address on file with the credit card provider. In contrast to definitional rules, behavioural rules are rules that can be violated directly. By definition, it is always poss ible to violate a behavioural rule—even if there are no circumstances under which the organization would approve that, and despite the fact that the organization  takes extraordinary precautions in its solution to prevent it. Because of this, further analysis should be conducted to determine how strictly the rule needs to  be enforced, what kinds of sanctions should be imposed when it is violated , and what addition al responses to a violation might be appropriate. Such an alysis often leads to specification of additional rules. Various levels of enforcement may be specified for a behavioural rule.': 252,\n",

It also facilitates evaluation of the success of each sub-component as it relates to other larger or smaller components. The depth of decomposition may vary depending on the nature of components and objectives. Functional decompositi on assumes that sub-components can and do completely describe their parent components. Any sub- component can have only one parent component when developing the functional hierarchy. The diagram below provides an example of how a function can be broken down to manageable, measur able sub-components.

Not for Distribution or Resale. .2 Measurement of Non-Functional Requirements Non-functional requirements often describe quality characteristics in vague terms, such as “the process must be easy to learn\", or “the system must respond quickly”. To be useful to developers of  a solution and to be verifiable, non- functional requirements must be quanti fied whenever poss ible. Including an appropriate measure of success provides the opportunity for verification. For example: • \"The process must be easy to learn\" can be expressed as \"90% of': 314,\n",

Measurement of the other categories of non-functional requirements is guided by the source of the requirement. For example: • certification requirements are generally specified in measurable detail by the organization setting the standard or convention, such as ISO Certification standards, • compliance requirements and localization requirements are set in measurable detail by their providers, • effective service level agreements state clearly the measures of success required, and • an organization’s enterprise architecture generally defines the solution environment requirements and specifie s exactly which platform or other attribute of the environment is required. .3 Context of Non-Functional Requirements Depending on the category of non-functional requirements, the context may have to be considered. For example, a regulatory agency may impose context- impacting compliance and security requir ements, or an organization that is expanding operations abroad may have to consider localization and scalability requirements. Determining th e optimal portfolio of non- functional requirements in a given organizational context is central to delivering value to stakeholders. The assessment of a non-functional re quirement, such as localization or maintainability, may impose contextual pressures on other non-functional requirements.

Root cause analysis uses  four main activities: •Problem Statement Definition : describes the issue to be addressed. •Data Collection : gathers information abou t the nature, magnitude, location, and timing of the effect. •Cause Identification : investigates the patterns of effects to discover the specific actions that co ntribute to the problem.Root Cause Analysis Techniques\": 345,\n",

This tool helps to focus on the cause of the problem versus the solution and organizes ideas for further analysis. The diagram serves as a map that depicts possible cause-and- effect relationships. Steps to develop a fishbone diagram include: Step 1. Capturing the issue or proble m under discussion in a box at the top of the diagram. Step 2. Drawing a line from the box across the paper or whiteboard (forming the spine of the fishbone). Step 3. Drawing diagonal lines from th e spine to represent categories of': 346,\n",

The five whys approach repeated ly asks questions in an attempt to get to the root cause of the problem. This is one of the simplest facilitation tools to use when problems have a human interaction component. To use this technique: Step 1. Write the problem on a flip chart or whiteboard.Step 2. Ask \"Why do you think this  problem occurs?\" and capture the idea below the problem. Step 3. Ask \"Why?\" again and capt ure that idea below the first idea. Continue with step 3 until you are conv inced the actual root cause has been identified. This may take more or less th an five questions—th e technique is called the five whys because it often takes th at many to reach the root cause, not because the question must be asked five times.

Scope models provide the basis for understanding the boundaries of: •Scope of Control : what is being analyzed, ro les and responsibilities, and what is internal and external to the organization. •Scope of Need : stakeholder needs, value to be delivered, functional areas, and organizational units to be explored. •Scope of Solution : requirements met, value delivered, and impact of': 348,\n",

For elements inside the scope of change, the business analyst is involved in establishing the ways those elements are modified. For el ements outside the scope of change but relevant to the chan ge, the business anal yst is involved in establishing the interactions between the change, the current and proposed solutions, and the context.

A proper level of detail provides a meaningful reduction of uncertainty while preventing 'a nalysis paralysis' at a scope definition stage. The elements of the final scope model can be described by enumerating them, by referring to a specific level of  their decomposition hierarchy, or by grouping them into logically bound sets. For example, a subject of change can be defined as a list of specific  business processes, as a high-level business process encompassing all of the m, or as a generic business function.
