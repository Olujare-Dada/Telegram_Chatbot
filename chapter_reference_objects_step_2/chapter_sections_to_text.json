Practitioners may employ different competencies, knowledge, skills, terminology, and attitudes that they use when performing busi ness analysis tasks. The BABOK\u00ae Guide  is a common framework for all perspectives, describing business analysis tasks that are performed to properly analyze a change or evaluate the necessity for a change. Tasks may vary in form, order, or importance for individual business analysts or for various initiatives.

Business analysis is the prac tice of enabling change in an enterprise by defining needs and recommending solu tions that deliver value to stakeholders. Business analysis enables an enterprise to articu late needs and the rationale for change, and to design and describe solutions that can deliver value.

A perspective can be thought of as a lens through which the business analysis practition er views their work activi ties based on the current context.

Analysis of business rules involves ca pturing business rules from sources, expressing them clearly, validating them with stakeholders, refi ning them to best align with business goals, and organizi ng them so they can be effectively managed and reused. Sources of business rules may be explicit (for example, documented business policies, regulations, or contracts) or tacit (for example, undocumented stakeholder know-how, genera lly accepted business practices, or norms of the corporate culture). Business rules should be explicit, specific, clear, accessible, and single sourced. Basic principles for business rules include: \u2022 basing them on standard business vo cabulary to enable domain subject matter experts to validate them, \u2022 expressing them separately from  how they will be enforced, \u2022 defining them at the atomic le vel and in declarative format, \u2022 separating them from processes they support or constrain,\u2022 mapping them to decisions the rule supports or constrains, and\u2022 maintaining them in a manner such  that they can be monitored and adapted as business circumstances evolve over time. A set of rules for making an operational business decision may be expressed as a decision table or decision tree, as described in Decision Analysis (p. 261).",
    "chunk_633_0": "The number of rules in such a set can be quite large, with a high level of complexity. 10.9.3 Elements Business rules require consistent use of bu siness terms, a glossary of definitions for the underlying business concepts, and an understanding of the structural connections among the concepts.

Sometimes definitions and structures from data dict ionaries or data models can be helpful (see Data Dictionary (p. 2 47) and Data Modelling (p. 2 56)).

Because of this, further analysis should be conducted to determine how strictly the rule needs to  be enforced, what kinds of sanctions should be imposed when it is violated , and what addition al responses to a violation might be appropriate.

Th is isolation helps reduce the complexity of the analysis. Breaking down larg er components into sub-co mponents allows scaling, tracking, and measuring work effort for each of them. It also facilitates evaluation of the success of each sub-component as it relates to other larger or smaller components. The depth of decomposition may vary depending on the nature of components and objectives. Functional decompositi on assumes that sub-components can and do completely describe their parent components. Any sub- component can have only one parent component when developing the functional hierarchy.

The success of BPM can be measured by how well the BPM initiative aligns to the objectives set for BPM in the organization. There are several mechanisms that can be used to implement BPM: \u2022Business process re-engineering : methods that aim for major process redesign across the enterprise. \u2022Evolutionary forms of change : methods that have overall objectives set for the process and then individual changes aimed at bringing sub-processes in line with those goals are implemented. \u2022Substantial discovery : methods are used when organizational processes are undefined or if the documented version of the process is substantially different from the actual process in use.
